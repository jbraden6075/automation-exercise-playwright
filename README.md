# Playwright Automation Project

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing of web applications. It includes reusable helper functions, page object models, and automated test flows for user registration and login scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jbraden6075/automation-exercise-playwright
    cd playwright
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. Install Playwright browsers:
    ```sh
    npx playwright install
    ```

## Running Tests

To run all tests:
```sh
npx playwright test
```

To run a specific test file:
```sh
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
```

To run tests in UI mode:
```sh
npx playwright test --ui
```

To view latest test report:
```sh
npx playwright show-report

## Helper Functions

- **randomAlphabeticString(length):** Generates a random alphabetic string.
- **randomNumericString(length):** Generates a random numeric string.
- **randomStateInput():** Returns a random US state.

Import and use these helpers in your test files or page objects as needed.

## Page Objects

- **LoginPage:** Encapsulates login and signup actions.
- **RegistrationPage:** Handles user registration flows.

## Best Practices

- Prefer waiting for selectors or URLs over explicit timeouts.
- Use the provided helper functions for generating test data.
- Organize tests and page objects for maintainability.
